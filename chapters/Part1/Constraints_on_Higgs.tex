\chapter{Constraints on the Higgs properties }\label{chap:HiggsConstr}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In this chapter, the bounds on the Higgs sector will be discussed. Starting from an overview of the theoretical constraints on the Higgs potential, like the quantum triviality and unitarity. Then, the state-of-the-art experimental results on Higgs properties and couplings measurements will be discussed. However, despite many of the Higgs boson properties have been measured with good accuracy, there are still difficult observables in the Higgs sector and some open problems. These will be addressed at the end of this chapter.
