\chapter{ Overview of Higgs pair production at colliders }\label{chap:overviewDiHiggs}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The dominant process for Higgs pair production at the LHC~(and hadron colliders in general) is the gluon gluon fusion~(ggF) via a heavy quark loop~$Q$, mainly the top and beauty quark, with the latter contributing only to about~$1\%$, see figure~\ref{fig_ggf_sm}.

This process is well-studied at leading order~(LO) analytically \cite{EBOLI1987269,GLOVER1988282,DICUS1988457,Plehn:1996wb}. The next-to-leading  QCD order~(NLO)   was initially computed using infinite top mass limit~($m_t \to \infty$) using the Higgs effective field theory~(HEFT) and implemented in the programme \texttt{Hpair}~\cite{Dawson:1998py}. However, this approximation is not suitable for obtaining distributions, and using numerical methods~\cite{Borowka:2016ypz,Borowka:2016ehy,Baglio:2018lrj} the full NLO results were obtained. In ~\cite{Heinrich:2019bkc}, parton shower effects were included in the NLO calculations, allowing the use of the NLO in event generators such as \textsc{Pythia} and \textsc{Powheg}. Analytical calculations for the NLO corrections using small Higgs transverse momentum~$p_{T,h} \to 0$ yielded a good estimation for the numerical result~\cite{Bonciani:2018omm}. The use of Pad\'e approximation obtained also analytical results for the NLO result and a description for the three-loop~(NNLO) form factors~\cite{Davies:2019nhm}. The NNLO cross section with top mass effects has been computed numerically in~\cite{Grazzini:2018bsd}.

In this work, we have calculated the  $ \sqrt{s} = 14$ \text{TeV}  LO ggF inclusive cross-section and distributions with modified light Yukawa couplings by including the light quark loops and the coupling $hh q \bar q$ described in the last diagram in figure~\ref{fig_ggf_diag} .

\end{figure}
The calculation was carried out using a FORTRAN code utilising the \texttt{VEGAS} integration algorithm, and NNPDF30 parton distribution functions~(PDF's)\cite{Ball:2017nwa} implemented via \texttt{LHAPADF-6} package\cite{Buckley:2014ana}. For the loop integrals~(see Appendix), we have used the \textsc{Collier} library~\cite{Denner:2014gla} for regularisation of the IR divergent light quark loops, that were assumed massless. A $K$-factor, for the NNLO correction were used according to the Higgs cross section working group recommended values~\cite{Dittmaier:2012vm,deFlorian:2016spz}:
\begin{equation}
	K = \frac{\sigma_{NNLO}}{\sigma_{LO}}, \;\;\;\;\; K_{14 \mathrm{TeV}} \approx 1.71.
\end{equation}
Since the cross-section is not expected to change a lot by changing the light Yukawa couplings, we use the same NNLO K-factor for all values of the scalings.
The renormalisation~$\mu_R$ and factorisation~$ \mu_F$ scales of the $\alpha_s$ and PDF running are set to $\mu_0 =0.5\, M_{hh}$, and $\alpha_s(M_Z) = 0.118$. In our calculations, we did not consider the quark mass running, as the later will be accounted for in the K-factor.
\subsubsection{Theoretical systematic uncertainties}
There are three main sources of theoretical \textit{systematic} uncertainties:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Scale uncertainty: coming form the arbitrariness of scales choice.
	\item PDF uncertainties : coming form the uncertainty in the PDF fitting and model.
	\item $\alpha_s$ running uncertainty: originating from the initial value (i.e. $\alpha_s(M_Z) $).
\end{enumerate}
In order compute these uncertainties, we follow the recommendations of the Higgs cross-section working group for the value and uncertainty of $\alpha_s$
\begin{equation}
	\alpha_s(M_Z) = 0.1180 \pm 0.0015,
\end{equation}
and the methods described in ~\cite{Martin:2009bu, Demartin:2010er}. for PDF and $\alpha_s$ uncertainties.
% should I put the formula ?
In order to calculate the scale uncertainties, the cross-section was computed with different $ \mu_R$ and $\mu_F$ values ranging between:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{M_{hh}}{4} \leq \mu_R/\mu_F  \leq \,M_{hh}
\end{equation}
The scale uncertainty for the LO total cross-section was found to be $+20\%, -16 \%$. Moreover, the PDF$+\alpha_s$ uncertainty was $\pm 6.8\%$.
\subsubsection{results}
The total cross sections with their uncertainties is shown in table~\ref{ggf_xsres}.
